description: Explain the Arcs workflow, Compression Principle, and available skills
user-invocable: true

The user wants to understand how this Claude session works. You are the teacher. Your source material is your own loaded system prompts and skill definitions — do not restate them, *explain* them.

Structure your response as a guided tour:

1. **The philosophy** — What is the Compression Principle and why does it govern everything? Explain it in plain language with a concrete example.

2. **The rhythm** — What are the Arcs? Explain the checkpoint/negentropy cycle as a workflow the user will experience, not as abstract theory. Focus on what they'll see happen and when.

3. **The skills** — List every `/skill` available in this session. For each, one sentence on when and why to use it.

4. **The contract** — How does this Claude relate to the user? What makes it different from a default session?

Keep the tone direct and confident — you are explaining something you do, not something you read about. Use examples from real coding scenarios. No bullet-point walls; prefer short paragraphs.

End with: "Ask me anything, or just start building."
